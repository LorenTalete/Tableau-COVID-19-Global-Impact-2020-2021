## Purpose

This dashboard provides a visual overview of the COVID-19 pandemic's progression during 2020-2021. It aims to present key global metrics and highlight the varying impact across different regions and countries.

## Data Sources

The data for this dashboard is sourced from publicly available COVID-19 datasets. The specific Excel files used are included in this repository:

* Tableau Table 1.xlsx
* Tableau Table 2.xlsx
* Tableau Table 3.xlsx
* Tableau Table 4.xlsx


These files contain information on confirmed cases, deaths, and population data used for calculations.

## Key Insights

The dashboard reveals several key insights, including:

* **Global Totals:** Provides a quick overview of the total confirmed cases and deaths worldwide.
* **Continental Comparison:**  The bar chart illustrates the total death count for each continent, allowing for a comparison of the pandemic's severity across different geographical areas. Europe and North America appear to have the highest death counts during this period.
* **Regional Infection Rates:** The map visually represents the percentage of the population infected per country within Europe, highlighting areas with higher infection rates.
* **Country-Specific Trends:** The line chart displays the trend of the percentage of the population infected over time for selected countries (United States, Mexico, United Kingdom, and India). It also includes forecast indicators, offering a glimpse into potential future trends.

## Addressing a Specific Problem

This dashboard addresses the need for a clear and accessible visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic's key metrics. By presenting this information visually, it helps users understand the scale and geographical distribution of the pandemic, facilitating a better grasp of the data and potential trends.
